		"0": "<p>Self-organizing teams lie at the heart of the agile methodology. They deliver results to end users while constantly corresponding with shareholders. A strong self-organizing team is the only requirement for the methodology to work. However, for such teams to work, there must be a certain level of accountability among team members. Several techniques can be used to achieve success, such as how team members are paired, domain knowledge, and creating incentives. It must be noted that self-organizing teams do have their limits, and are only as good as the management that organize the team. </p>",

		"2": "<p>The first concept to realize is that self organizing is not the same as self-management. Team members should only be paired when their skill sets are uniform, and not too polarizing. When there is strong similarity, there is case for effective communication and thus better results. In order for skill sets to improve within the organization, employees who are less knowledgeable should be grouped with those who are. This creates an atmosphere of peer learning.</p><br>",
		"3": "<p>Another tenet that requires such teams to work is to incentive the teams. While this means giving rewards when necessary, it also means that the team has to not be burdened with indomitable amounts of work. The very absence of an unrealistic goal negates all attempts of trying. Furthermore, incentives.</p>",

		"1": "<p>In today’s corporate climate, more and more companies are switching to using the agile methodology to manage their projects and make progress in the workspace. As one of the most important individuals in the typical Agile process is a scrum master, the demand of this job has been steadily rising since Agile became popular. The job is a demanding one, and requires proper certifications before a company will be willing to hire.</p>",
		"2": "<p>Self organizing teams have been a staple of the Agile methodology for a significant amount of time. Essentially, they can be defined as a self-governing group of individuals that all work towards the same goals, without any clear overlord boss lording over them. These groups are much different than the traditional work hierarchy from the past, and this type of management style can lead to increased productivity if done correctly.</p>",
		"3": "<div id=\"w4Nei2\" class=\"anImage\"><span style=\"font-weight:;\">Figure 2</span></div>",
		"4": "<p>This may be true, however, there are a few flaws with the true concept of self-organizing teams that keep it from becoming the most accepted management style in the modern business scene.</p>",
		"5": "<p>As stated previously, compared to traditional management styles, there is nobody to force or order people to do work on a self organizing team. One of the main disadvantages of this management philosophy is derived from the concept of self-motivation. Typically, in classic systems with a boss, work is assigned by the boss, and the individuals on the team must complete the work or face being fired by the boss. In a self-organizing team, the process of work division and accountability fall on the employees themselves. This essentially takes the responsibilities of a traditional boss and divides it among the employees. </p>",
		"6": "<p>The CSPO, or ‘Certified Scrum Product Owner’ certification is a more advanced version of the CSM cert. This program is similar to the CSM cert, as it is typically a 2 day course offered for $1000. The main difference between the CSM and the CSPO is that the CSPO degree focuses heavily on the product owner side of the scrum master job. Essentially, a scrum product owner has much more responsibility than the average scrum master, as they are essentially almost a project manager and scrum master wrapped into one (O’Callaghan). This certification is useful if you wish to acquire a job that involves these two aspects. However, it is not necessary for most scrum master jobs.</p>",
		"7": "<p>The reason why this could potentially be a disadvantage is that in order to achieve success, employees in this system need more self motivation compared to employees in a classic management system. The employees need to care enough to motivate each other to share an equal burden of the work. When the employees are motivated, care, and are willing to work, then the team will thrive. However, without this motivation, tasks may become unevenly distributed among the team due to laziness, and the project might fail. This is one of the flaws with self-organizing teams, and why not all of them succeed.</p>",
		"8": "<p>This is the reason why, according to research completed by The Shift Index, only 15 percent of self-organizing teams reach their full potential. (Hundermark). This method can work fine, but without motivated team members, it will be doomed to fail.</p>",
		"9": "<p>The PMI-ACP is the ‘Agile Certified Practitioner’ certificate offered by the Project Management Institute. This is one of the most prestigious certificated that one can acquire, and is only realistically obtainable after one has completed a CSM cert, had experience working on Agile projects. This certification is much more in-depth than the CSM certification, and expounds on the knowledge that one learns in the earlier degrees. With a CSM and PMI-ACP certification, and some prior work experience, one could easily get a higher-paying job ($100,000+) as a scrum master. </p>",

Different personalities and characteristics help differentiate between great scrum masters and not so great scrum masters.

A great scrum master should never assume that their team can handle their own impediments. One critical job of the scrum master is to help the team by taking care of any impediments. Failure to handle the impediments will snowball until they become unmanageable.</p>",
		"8": "<p>Another weakness that MattGrommes mentions is when the scrum master thinks they are in charge of the team. A scrum master should not have direct control over the team because the team is supposed to be self-managing. This creates a bad atmosphere for the team and is detrimental to the agile methodology. A scrum master that is trying to manage the team is trying to incorporate waterfall techniques into agile.</p>",
		"9": "<p>The final weakness, according to Pepijn van de Vorst, is when a scrum master tends to take over a task of a product owner when the product owner does not finish the tasks. Scrum masters should not be taking over work from other team members, but instead, they should be working to resolve any impediments that are causing the work to not be completed.</p>",
