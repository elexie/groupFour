This was before I had taken any project management classes so I simply assumed that the term was created by the show’s writers, and unrelated to actual software development. However, in subsequent courses, I learned more about scrum and its place in structuring the software creation process. When I began writing this article, I google search several combinations of the word along with the name of large multinational corporations or internet companies. Since these companies develop products that serve billions of people, I was interested in learning about whether they used scrum in their product develop cycles.\"Scrum at Goldman Sachs,\" \"Scrum at Facebook,\" \"Scrum at Google\" were a few terms I tried. I followed one of the search results to a job listing for \"scrum master\" at Goldman Sachs, and was surprised that the job requirements and responsibilities mentioned terms I had read.</p>",
    "1":"<p>Scrum is a methodology used by agile teams to complete a their goals. The essence of the scrum methodology is its partitioning of goals and completion of those goals through self-driven teams. Instead of assigning specific tasks to each team member, the team organizes itself to meets specific deadlines at the end of each <i>sprint</i>. A sprint is a timeframe dedicated to completing a specific part of the project. Sprints begin after the shareholder specifies the list of features they would like to see in the final project (Westland). Such project requirements are written in a document called the <i>Product Backlog</i>. However The list of features completed by the team is written in another document called the <i>Sprint Backlog</i>. Throughout a sprint, the team must have daily meetings, usually about 15 minutes, where each team member updates the team on the current state of the project. (\"What is Scrum Methodology?\") Sprints are repeated for each goal until the project deadline arrives.</p>",
    "2":"<p>A key founder of the scrum development process, and coauthor of the \"Agile Manifesto,\" Jeff Sutherland credits the success of Spotify to its used of scrum. In the same article, he writes that \"in order for your smaller, growing software company to compete with the big dogs, it has to nail Agile.\"The success of Spotify relative to its much larger competitors is noteworthy. By market capitalization, it is a small company compared to its three main competitors: Google Apple, and Amazon. However, Spotify it remained the most widely used music store. In 2015, Sutherland credited Spoitfy’s success to their application of scrum. Sutherland’s main goal in creating agile was not to simply cross out a list of features on the product backlog, but to empower \"disempowered engineers\" and to \"get the manager out of the way.\" This inherent mistrust of top-down management is the essence of the scrum methodology.<p>",

  "varn":[{"0":"<p>Roles on Agile project teams are just as important as the process. Each team member plays a role that includes responsibilities crucial for the success of the project. These roles must interact together in sync as the goal is for them to respond to change as quickly as possible. There are two main styles of Agile process: Scrum and Kanban. Scrum and Kanban are both iterative implementations of the Agile framework. The main difference is that Kanban doesn’t predefine roles, to be more receptive to constant change (Kanban vs. Scrum). The same responsibilities of Scrum roles may however be taken on by different people throughout the project.</p>",
      "1":"<p>Agile teams are small by design, and therefore have few roles. The team should be self-sufficient and flexible. The roles assigned are not positions, but just titles for the project, and the roles may interleave throughout the project. (Ambler) The first role is the Team Leader or the Scrum Master in Scrum. The person placed in this role is responsible for ensuring the team is in sync on the project and facilitating the flow. This role takes on less management roles than similar titles on other teams. The team lead should focus more on helping the team than telling the team. The next role is the Product Owner. This position should be the customer or at least the representation for the customer’s requirements (The 3 Main Roles). Requirements gathering, and prototyping are important activities to include the Product Owner for feedback.</p>",
      "2":"<p> The other members on the team play the role of team members. They are responsible for carrying out the majority of the project. Agile aims to include everyone in all parts of the project. More power is put into the team members hands than on other teams.  “The team members will normally be comprised of developers, QA, and documentation” (Haaf). The last role is not directly part of the team, however are just important. These people play the role of Stakeholders. Stakeholders are anyone who has a ‘stake’ in the project, or basically anyone who cares or will care about the outcome of the project. Stakeholders will not all be experts, although some may be, most will be users and investors (The 3 Main Roles). This role plays a major part in the project process and could be the driving force behind a directional change any time in the project.</p>",
      "3":"<p>Larger Agile teams may exist, however will utilize the same conceptual roles. They essentially form “teams of teams”. (Ambler). There may be some experts included to help the team as a supporting cast. As the size of Agile teams expands, the roles are shaped to the needs of the project more than just based off the framework. Regardless, the conceptual roles of smaller Agile teams are still used as a basis.</p>",

  "win":[{"0":"<p>The agile methodology has been around since the early 90s, officially being dated back to 2001 with the publication of the Agile Manifesto (TechBeacon). This time frame is no coincidence for the birth of the agile methodology. Agile relies in iterations.  The agile methodology mindset has existed for many years prior, but was only adopted for software development when the Internet made it feasible. A working product is continuously delivered to clients and features are added and modified through subsequent iterations. This very nature of agile is why this methodology took off around the 2000s. Around the turn of the century, high speed internet was becoming more commonplace in homes and businesses - DSL and other broadband connections were coming. It is important to define the Internet as the interconnectivity between the world’s computers. This ability to interconnect devices together is critical to an agile work environment.</p>",
    "1":"<p>Prior to the advent of the Internet, products were burned to compact discs or other older media. This system catered to the waterfall methodology because the cost of manufacturing hundreds or even thousands of discs was not cheap. Imagine using agile in a time where the Internet was not as prevalent or quick as today, and burning discs is not as cheap as today. Agile without the Internet would mean burning and shipping discs for every minor release or bug fix. With waterfall the software is basically finalized when it is shipped. Even during the products development many discs would have to be burned if trying to use the agile methodology without the Internet.</p>",
    "2":"<p>The ability to alter software post-release is a huge advantage to the agile methodology. Waterfall can leverage the Internet in the same way, but it is not as essential to the methodology. Agile is a great methodology to adapt when software reaches release and enters into its support lifecycle. In the support lifecycle, the product does not have an end in sight, not until the stakeholder determines that it is time for the software to no longer be supported.</p>",
    "3":"<p>Agile in software development usually relies on a centralized repository for code to be submitted to and managed from. Git is one such software, and without the Internet would not work as well as it does with the Internet. One could argue that the Internet is not needed for Git, which is true, Git can be ran in a lan environment just fine. The Internet caused the world to move forward at a rapid rate. Creating software before the Internet was not as big of a moving target as it is now with the Internet. The Internet brought the world together and brought competition with it.Waterfall having such a defined project plan is something that makes it struggle in a world with the Internet. By the time a waterfall software project is complete, the target has already moved likely several times. \"Waterfall is appropriate for project where requirements are fixed and work proceeds to completion in a linear way. If the software work is fast-paced and subject to a never-ending stream of changes in features, functions and information content, then the most suitable approach is Agile. This model speaks the most to the Age of the internet, where products are in a permanent state of evolution\" (Farshore).</p>",
